    """Creates the training and validation datasets for recognition training.

    The datasets are created based on a CSV file that contains all image paths
    with a corresponding label. The images are split up into a training and a
    validation subset. The data split is based on labels, so no label will
    occur both in the training and in the validation subset. We do this to
    reflect a real-world recognition scenario where the labels used during
    training do not occur during inference.

    For the train-validation split, we use a folds-based approach that allows
    for easy K-fold cross-validation. How the dataset is split is determined by
    `num_folds` (the number of folds), `val_fold` (which fold to use for
    validation) and `k_fold_seed` (the seed used for the random generator that
    shuffles the labels before creating the folds). For example, when setting
    `num_folds = 5`, each value for `val_fold` from 0 to 4 gives rise to
    another validation set and another training set. Training and evaluation
    with each of these different combinations of train and validation datasets,
    thus comes down to a 5-fold cross validation.

    The validation set is further split into a query and a gallery set. These
    sets contain the same labels but different images. The gallery set provides
    references with which the images in the query set should be compared. This
    is again to reflect a real-world scenario where a gallery of references is
    used to identify a given query.

    The query-gallery split is determined by `n_refs` (the number of references
    per label) and `rand_ref_seed` (the seed for the random generator that
    shuffles the data before splitting).

    Args:
        data_csv_file: The path of the CSV file containing the images and
            corresponding labels.
        label_key: The column in the CSV file that contains the label of each
            image.
        image_key: The column in the CSV file that contains th image path of
            each image.
        num_folds: The number of folds to use for splitting the dataset into
            training and validation. Note that the folds are label-based, not
            sample-based.
        val_fold: The index of the fold to use for validation. The others will
            be used for training.
        k_fold_seed: The random seed to use for k-fold splitting.
        n_refs: The number of references per class in the gallery.
        rand_ref_seed: The state of the random generator used for randomly
            choosing gallery reference images.
        tfm_train: The transform to apply to the training images.
        tfm_val: The transform to apply to the validation images.

    Returns:
        A tuple with three datasets: the training dataset, the gallery dataset
        and the query dataset.
